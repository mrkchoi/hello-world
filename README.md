Hi All!

Kenny here. I work in digital marketing at a boutique agency in Silicon Valley. I'm interested in learning how to code in order to further my technical skillset, and possibly make a transition into either a) using code to supplement my marketing background, or b) dive into the development rabbit hole full time (eventually) :)
